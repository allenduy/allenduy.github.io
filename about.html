    <p>Hello. You must be here just exploring the website or you actually want to know more about me. Well, here goes. Keep reading if you care to. ☺ (If you do, thanks!)</p>
    <p>First of all, you should know that my name is Allen Nguyen. I have successfully completed my four years of high school, and am currently a college student attending Arizona State University, majoring in Computer Science. I was originally majoring in architecture, but it didn't turn out too well for me and I switched; however, I still hope that I can eventually get myself an architectural license. Also, if you're curious about my internet name "L1aRx" or "xL1aR," I picked a song title from my music selection that seemed like a pretty good username, also if I liked the song itself, and I decided to use the song title, "liar," by Ayumi Hamasaki.</p>

    <p>Now for some of my interests. Music is probably one of the biggest pieces of my life. I don't mind a lot of music genres, but there are a few that I just can't listen to. However, I do have some preferences: K-pop, a little bit of J-pop and American pop, indie pop, soul, and some others. Maybe hip-hop as well. One of my other biggest interests is art. I like graphic art, and traditional drawing. I wouldn't call myself amazing, but I guess I'm pretty good at it. If you'd like to know more about how I got into that or general interests, please feel free to ask!</p>
    <p>On my spare time, when I feel like doing so, I would fold origami (tried working on 1000 cranes - although I started awhile ago, I still have a long way to go - I'm slacking!!), watch anime, sleep, eat, nap, etc. Yeah, I know, where did my life go? But apart from that, I just recently started to get myself into small personal projects. It mostly involves coding websites.</p>

    <p>You might have already guessed, but I also have an interest in web design. You can see by looking at my website that I am more of a minimalist, and love the clean, sleek, and modern look. By modern, I mean both eccentric and simple - either can be very attractive in their own ways. However, I also like it combined with vintage, such as the use of photography, though I don't think I have any vintage on this website. Speaking of photography, although I'm not very experienced in that area at all, but I feel that I may eventually dive further into it. The eight images you see on this page are the only ones that belong to me. Any other image you see (besides the one of myself, below) are credited below.</p>
    <p>Well then, I guess I'll stop there. If you want to know more, befriend me (I might be a bit socially awkward, so sorry about that), stalk me, or whatever, but please don't go too far. Seriously. By the way, below is the image of myself, old by a few years. I seriously need to get that updated.</p>
